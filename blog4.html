              <h4>Renewable Energy</h4>
              <h6>By Salihu Usman</h6>
              <h3>
                What Students Should Know About the Renewable Energy Revolution?
            </h3>
              <p>
                    <b>“Renewable energy”</b> is energy derived from naturally replenishing sources. It includes solar, wind energy, hydroelectric, ocean, geothermal, biomass and hydrogen. Renewable energy use has many benefits for people, the economy and the planet, including reducing global warming, improving public health, job creation, affordability, and reliability.  As non-renewable sources dwindle and disruptive events like droughts and heat waves increase, the need for clean, resilient renewable energy continues to grow. The good news? A clean energy revolution is currently underway as the renewable energy sector expands and evolves. Read on for a roundup of the latest news on the renewable energy movement. <br>
            </p>
            <b>The potential of renewable energy:</b>
            Earlier this year, the World Economic Forum (WEF), reported that an extensive body of research examining different situations and geographies indicates that a “fully sustainable global energy landscape” is possible by 2050. However, for it to happen on this accelerated timeline, it will take the support of policymakers, businesses, and other organizations. The results would be profound. Not only would this greener world reduce the impact of climate change and the floods, storms, and other extreme weather events it causes, but as many as seven million deaths from air pollution could be prevented annually.  <br> <br>

            <b>On regional trends:</b>

            Home to the world’s largest and most competitive clean energy auction market, India has been hailed as “a model for the world” in the renewable energy revolution. It’s also on track to achieve its ambitious renewable power target of 450 gigawatt (GW) over the next 10 years, according to the Sustainable Energy in America Factbook. <br> <br>

            India isn’t alone in its leadership. Developing countries in the global South, which refers to the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, are also making record investments in renewable energy, according to 2020’s Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment report. <br> <br>

            The central borough of Australia’s largest city, Sydney, is now completely powered by wind and solar energy for an emissions savings of the equivalent of 6,000 homes. The shift will save in the neighborhood of 20,000 tons of CO2.  <br> <br>

            Exciting things are happening in Sweden, including the erection of the first wooden wind power tower on the island of Björkö outside Gothenburg. A major breakthrough for next-generation wind turbines, the tower is stronger, cheaper, and more eco-friendly than steel alternatives. "Wind power is expected to be the EU's largest power source as early as 2027. With wind towers in wood, we get even more climate-smarter renewable electricity to face the climate crisis," says Ola Carlson, director of the Swedish Wind Power Technology Centre and assistant professor of renewable power generation. <br> <br>

            Floating wind farms are also having a major moment, with Dr. Thomas Hillig stating that they are positioned to play a significant role in the second phase of the renewable energy revolution. Leading the way is the world’s first floating wind farm in Peterhead, Scotland, which features first-of-their-kind wind turbines constructed in Stord, Norway. <br> <br>

            Following the introduction of its Offshore Wind Promotion Act aimed at assisting the development of Japan’s offshore wind power market, the country is in the process of developing offshore wind farms at 30 sites over the next decade. <br> <br>

            Wavestar, a facility located in Denmark, is equipped with kinetic-energy harvesters known as “floats,” which convert kinetic wave power into continuous energy. It can be upgraded to utilize wind and solar power, as well. <br> <br>

              <p>Energy is essential to life and all living organisms. The sun, directly or indirectly, is the source of all the energy available on Earth. Our energy choices and decisions impact Earth's natural systems in ways we may not be aware of, so it is essential that we choose our energy sources carefully</p>
